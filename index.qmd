The ComBatFamQC package is an innovative solution designed to enhance the process of <span style="color:coral;">batch effect diagnostics</span>, <span style="color:yellowgreen;">harmonization</span>, and <span style="color:cornflowerblue;">post-harmonization downstream analysis</span>. 

By providing interactive qualitative visualization alongside rigorous statistical testing, this package empowers users to effectively identify potential batch effects in their data. Beyond, ComBatFamQC includes a range of built-in harmonization techniques that simplify the harmonization process, ensuring that researchers can achieve optimal results without the need for extensive technical expertise. Additionally, ComBatFamQC allows the creation of interactive lifes-pan age trend plots of individual brain features with estimated age-adjusted centiles. It also
includes functions to easily generate covariate-corrected residuals that could be used as inputs
for downstream machine learning models.

The package leverages the capabilities of **R Shiny** to offer interactive visualizations for both batch effect diagnostics and age trend analysis, presenting data in an accessible format that enhances interpretability.

To cater to a diverse user base, ComBatFamQC includes two user-friendly command-line interfaces that guide users through different stages of the processing pipeline:

-   The **CombatQC_CLI.R** script focuses on the batch effect diagnostics and harmonization stage, providing interactive tools to diagnose and adjust for batch effects effectively. 

-   The **post_CLI.R** script is dedicated to the post-harmonization stage, where users can visualize age trends across various brain structures and generate a residual dataset that excludes the effects of unwanted covariates. 

Together, these components make ComBatFamQC a comprehensive and accessible tool for researchers working with complex datasets in neuroimaging and other related fields.
